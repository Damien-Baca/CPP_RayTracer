### Running The Program

1. Before running verify you have [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/) and [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) installed.
 	 - The UNIX command *diff* is also used for testing.
2. Run the makefile by simply typing:

		make

- `Driver002` make take a few seconds to finish rendering

3. After execution the rendered images are found in the /images/ directory.
4. The makefile additionally tests the results against known good images in the
   /driver/ directory. The results can be viewed in 'diff.txt'. An empty file
	 means no differences found.
